The pdfs on current directory are plots for plane U, trained in this way:
	* model_5 : custom mse applied: used batch size 1, ~20 epochs, w1 = 1, w2=0.7
	* for this one, w2=0.7 was not applied to pure noise windows
	
	* plts_cnn_-6-14_10pages.pf has 10 pages of plots where the cnn out put is between
	  0.06 and 0.14. All of the waves here have signals in the 200-tck window
	* plts_cnn_-6-14_10pages_NOISE.pdf also has plots with cnn out put between 0.06 and 0.14
	  However, all the waves here are PURE noise
	* in plots, blue curve is the target(ground truth) and magenta is model_5's prediction
	  gray is original input
	
./fixed_weight has the same content as above, but for a slightly different model
	* model_8 : custom mse applied: used batch size 1, ~20 epochs, w1 = 1, w2=0.7
	* unlike model_5, model_7 applies w2=0.7 to pure noise windows

./compr_5_5
	* plot truth (blue) model_5 (green) and model_8 (magenta) on top of eachother

./tmp
	* should be empty

./tmp2
	* place to store plots just to test
